## Inspiration
WE LOVE DOGS!

## What it does
Our project is a database system that can store a list of dogs up for adoption. Users could add, view, and remove dogs as they are being adopted or brought into the adoption center. It is simple and easy to use so that anyone not tech-savvy can still use it. 

## How we built it
We built it using Python, in the working environment Replit, and used GitHub for repository storage.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team faced many challenges including bugs, program crashes, syntax errors, and runtime errors. None of us were experienced with using Python and making a GUI so we had to learn everything from scratch and do hard research.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we have made a successful system for storing and managing the lives of many dogs out of nothing but scratch. Also, we were able to integrate the front-end and back-end design of our program.

## What we learned
We learned a new coding language (Python) and how to implement a GUI into our program using the Tkinter framework. While it was difficult, testing around with the GUI and learning how to combine both front and back end development was interesting.

## What's next for Dog Database
Our hope is that animal shelters can use this simple software as a startup to store dogs and their info. Hopefully, in the future, we could implement a simpler design to our program.
